	be accessed via the variable ldap_connection and a vaild position
	within the LDAP directory in the variable ldap_position. It reuses
	an already open connection or creates a new one. If the function
	fails with an LDAP error the decorators tries to reopen the LDAP
	connection and invokes the function again. if it still fails an
	LDAP_ConnectionError is raised.

	When using the decorator the method gets two additional keyword arguments.

	example:
	  @LDAP_Connection
	  def do_ldap_stuff( arg1, arg2, ldap_connection = None, ldap_positio = None ):
		  ...
		  ldap_connection.searchDn( ..., position = ldap_position )
