Description: Node.js (0.8.10) event-based server-side javascript engine
 Node.js is similar in design to and influenced by systems like Ruby's Event
 Machine or Python's Twisted.
 .
 It takes the event model a bit further - it presents the event loop as a
 language construct instead of as a library.
 .
 Node.js is bundled with several useful libraries to handle server tasks :
 System, Events, Standard I/O, Modules, Timers, Child Processes, POSIX, HTTP,
 Multipart Parsing, TCP, DNS, Assert, Path, URL, Query Strings.
