<p>During the saving process, a domain join will be executed, as well.
For this, it is necessary to enter a valid domain administrator account on all system roles except domaincontroller master, where a new domain will be created.
After the successful domain join, the configuration wizard may be closed in order to continue with the boot process.</p>
<p>The configuration can also be conducted via a web browser from an external system. In this case, a subsequent relogin at Univention Management Console will be necessary.</p>
<p>The initial configuration can be modified at any later point via the UMC module "Basic settings".</p>
