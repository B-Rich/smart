Welcome to Univention Corporate Server (UCS)!

This system was configured with a random or default password. It is
recommended to change the password of the administrative root account.
To do so, please enter the following command and type in your password
twice:
 passwd root

This system is not completely configured yet. To finalise the configuration
of this system you need to login to the web-based Univention Management
Console which can be reached with a web browser under the following URL

import os
import socket
import fcntl
import struct
import urllib2
from univention.config_registry.interfaces import Interfaces

def get_ip_address(ifname):
	s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
	try:
		# SIOCGIFADDR == 0x8915
		addr = socket.inet_ntoa(fcntl.ioctl( s.fileno(), 0x8915, struct.pack('256s', ifname[:15]))[20:24])
	except IOError:
		addr = None
	return addr

res = None
if configRegistry.is_true('server/amazon', False):
	socket.setdefaulttimeout(2)
	try:
		res = urllib2.urlopen('http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname')
		print '  https://%s' % res.read()
	except urllib2.URLError:
		pass

if not res:
	interfaces = Interfaces(configRegistry)
	for ifname, iface in interfaces.all_interfaces:
		#IPv4
		if iface.type == 'dhcp':
			addr = get_ip_address(ifname)
			print '  https://%s/' % (addr,)
		else:
			addr = iface.ipv4_address()
			if addr:
				print '  https://%s/' % (addr.ip,)
		# IPv6
		addr = iface.ipv6_address()
		if addr:
			print '  https://[%s]/' % (addr.ip,)

The login at the Univention Management Console needs to be done with
the user root and the new password you entered in the above-mentioned
password change.
