# The following directives define some format nicknames for use with
# a CustomLog directive (see below).

# The location of the access logfile (Common Logfile Format).
# If this does not start with /, ServerRoot is prepended to it.

CustomLog /var/log/apache/access.log common

# If you would like to have an agent and referer logfile uncomment the
# following directives.

#CustomLog /var/log/apache/referer.log referer
#CustomLog /var/log/apache/agent.log agent

# If you prefer a single logfile with access, agent and referer information
# (Combined Logfile Format) you can use the following directive.

#CustomLog /var/log/apache/access.log combined

# PidFile: The file the server should log its pid to
PidFile /var/run/apache.pid

# ScoreBoardFile: File used to store internal server process information.
# Not all architectures require this.  But if yours does (you'll know because
# this file is created when you run Apache) then you *must* ensure that
# no two invocations of Apache share the same scoreboard file.
# ScoreBoardFile logs/apache_runtime_status

# The LockFile directive sets the path to the lockfile used when Apache
# is compiled with either USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT or
# USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT. This directive should normally be left at
# its default value. The main reason for changing it is if the logs
# directory is NFS mounted, since the lockfile MUST BE STORED ON A LOCAL
# DISK. The PID of the main server process is automatically appended to
# the filename.

LockFile /var/run/apache.lock
